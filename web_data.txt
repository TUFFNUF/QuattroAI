Great stay at the Quattro. Our room was very nice, exactly what we needed. We really enjoyed the pool, water temperature was right on. We also enjoyed the breakfast, plenty of options to choose from.We didn't have dinner in the restaurant but would try it next time. Would definitely stay again.
The staff is always super friendly and the place is always well maintained and clean. There was 8 of us in our party with two rooms as we had the family suites, and not a single complaint, ever. We’ve stayed at other places in SSM when we couldn’t get a reservation in the Quattro and others places just don’t compare to the cleanliness and hospitality of the a Quattro. We’ve been staying there for 15+ years and it’s by far our favorite place to stay at in Sault Ste Marie.

Terrific hotel with all the great amenities you would expect plus more including salt water pool area large enough to do laps. Large clean dry sauna to relax and unwind. Terrific complimentary breakfast included with lot of choices. Room is clean with a separate sitting area. Let's not forget the comfortable bed and pillows. Great sleep assured.

This was our first time staying at the Quattro Hotel in SSM Ontario. Very impressed with the size and cleanliness of the one bedroom suite we had. The complimentary breakfast was the best we had in a long time. The scrambled eggs were real eggs and not the powder type served at many hotels that offer free breakfast. We had dinner in the restaurant. The service, pricing and quality of the food was excellent. We will definitely be back!

Excellent family hotel! Travelled with 3 family members. Suites were huge, nice little kitchenette with table and chairs included. The pool is amazing! It's salt water and very clean. My teenagers loved the sauna and the breakfast. Honestly, probably the best croissant I have ever had! Lots of hot food options which was great for my gluten free, dairy free eater. Staff was friendly and kind. The hand soap is coconut and smells great. Beds were comfy and AC worked fantastic. Value is superb at this hotel. We did have to walk up one flight of stairs and we got a little lost a few times. :)

We cannot wait to stay again. The room was massive, clean and modern. The included breakfast was delicious. The hotel was clean, and the staff were friendly. The only downside was that the hot tub seems to be out of commission for good, which may be taking into consideration next time but otherwise, the hotel and stay were great

The front desk staff are always efficient and friendly. The rooms are large, spacious and clean and they have a really great free breakfast that is included in your rate. It has a large selection of breads and pastries/yogurt/cereals/eggs/bacon/sausage/coffee/juice/fresh fruit etc. They even have paper cups so you can take a coffee to go in the car. The wait staff in the breakfast room are always very friendly.

There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the Hotel for dinner and we always like to do that to stretch our legs after being in the car all day.
Great breakfast with lots of options (sausages, eggs, croissant, toast, fruit, yogurt, cereal, juice), decent gym. Helpful staff when we needed to change to ground level room. Good sized rooms that were clean and comfortable. Pool looked good.

Excellent choice for a hotel. Front desk staff was lovely, kind and professional. Room was spacious and clean and had lots of nice touches like tea towels for the kitchenette. Shower was ah-maz-ing. Hot breakfast hit all the highlights: potatoes, eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal and Pastries. Lots of nice touches, little extras. Great experience, great value for money.
